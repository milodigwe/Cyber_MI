# Information and Cybersecurity Principles

## Notes 
- ** Information Security CIA Triad
    - Confidentialty : assurance that information is not disclosed to auauthorized persons, processes or devices
    - Integrity : Integrity is the principle that systems are trustworthym and work as intended, and data is completed and accurate
    - Availability : Availability is the principle that informatin systems and supporting infra are operating and accessbile when needed.

- Privacy is the right of an indvidual to control the use of their personal information
    - Consumers expect their privacy to be respected and their personal information to be protected by the org with which they do business.
    - Strategic Alignment : Every seecurity and privacy decision and action must be strategically aligned with the needs of the organization

# ** Strategic Alignment
- Cybersecurity must be viewed holistically and through an enterprise risk managment lens, Adequate funding is required.
    - Strategic Alignment Terminology
    - Mission : defines the org purpose and values
    - Goals : broad aspirations
    - Strategy : is plan, approach or set actions that an or employs to achieve long term goals
    - Objectives : are specific, measurable, and time-bound targets that support the org goals and strategies.
    - Risk Management : Identify and mitigate risk to an acceptable level

- Measuring Progress and Success
    - KGI : Key Goal Indication : metrics used to measure progress toward achieving key goals, strategies or high-level objective with an org. KGI  measure of outcome
    - KPI: Key Performance Indication are metrics used to evalute performance. Measure of execution

** Every deceision must align with the organziations security standards.

# ** Orgnizational Roles and Responsibilites 

* - Enterprise governance is the system by which entities are directed, controlled, and held
to account
- Goal - articulate the org desire (future) state of security
- Stewardship is the responsible oversight and protection of something entrusted to one's care.

- Chief Information Security Officer
- CISO : role interprets strategic direction and is generally held accountable for the success or failure of the Information security program.

Functional Roles
- Owners are responsible for oversight and decisions related to classification, access control, and protection
- Custodians are responsible for advising, implementing, managing, and monitoring data protection controls.

# Security Control Frameworks
* - Framework is a logical structure. The intent of a framework is to document and organize processes.
- Govername framework articulates the various elements of governance programs
- Information security framework guides the dev and mgmt of an information security program that supports business objectibe.


# ** Understand Legal, Regulatory, and Compliance Issues that Pertain to Information Security In a Hollstic Context

* - Compliance mean acting in accordance with applicable rules, laws, policies, and obligations
    - GRC is a system used by org to structure goverance, risk management, and regulatory compliance. Goal is to unify and align org approach to risk management and regulatory compliance.

* - Jurisdiction is the power or right of a legal or political agency to exercise its authority over a person, subject matter or territory.
    - Org need to document all applicable jurisdiction location of data and systems (pressing, transmissions, and storage)

# Intellectual Property & Transborder DataFlow

* - Intellectual Property (IP) Law : IP laws is a branch of law that deals with protection of intangible creations. Ex. Commerical, artistic, literary
- Freeware Shareware Open Source  Commerical off the Shelf 

# Privacy Principles
 - Privacy statement describes how an org collects, uses, shares, and protects personal information collected from individuals

 - Data Owner is responsible for protecting the data in compliance with all applicable regulations
 - Data Controller determines the purposes for which and the means by which personal data is processed
 - Data Processor processes personal data on behalf of the Controller

# Cybercrime and Data Breaches
Scenario of Data Breach
    1. Inform and involve execute management
    2. Executive managment should reach out to legal counsel for guidance
    3. Time to activate your incident response plan and crisis communication plans
    4. Consider sharing threat intelligence with applicable agnecies and org.

# Business Continuity Planning
- Threat assessment : This activity focuses on identification and prioritization of adverse conditions that impact the organization.
- Business Continuity Plan - BCP : Describes the overall strategy for sustaining the business in adverse conditions

# Busines Impact Analysis
- Business Impact Analysis (BIA) : identify essential services and business processes and to characterize system components and interdependences.
    - Identify single points of failure
    - evaulate resources needed to resume business and processes
    - establishing a process order to bring systems online .

- Maximum Tolerable Downtime (MTD) : max time a process/service can be unavailable with causing harm (impact) to the business.
    - Service Delivery Objective (SDO) : acceptable level of operations in alternate processes mode. Operations less than functional but sufficient to sustain business.
    - MTD Impact Considerations : Dependencies, Fluctuations, Financial, Regulatory, Reputational, and Contractual
    - RPO
    - RTO

# Understand and Apply Risk Management Concepts

# Risk Basics 
* - Cascading risk is the principle that risks are linked and failing to address one risk could cause a chain reaction.
* - Risk appetite is the level of risk that an organization is comfortable enaging in

# Risk Assessment 
- Scoping the process of defining parameters, establishing the foucs of the assessment, determing what wil be included, identying stakeholders, establishing timeframes, and reporting guidelines.
    - Setting the parameters of a risk assessment - Risk Scoping
    - Public Sector means Government

# Risk Analysis
- Risk analysis is the process by which the likelihood impact, and level of risk are determined
    - Inherent risk level of risk before controls and safeguards have been implemented
    - Residual risk level of risk after  controls and safeguards have been implemented

- Risk heat map visual representation of risk. Colors indicate the level of risk associated with different events or factors.
- Quantitative risk analysis assigns numeric values to all elements of analysis
    - Asset Value (AV) : Value of a resource to the organization
    - Exposure Factor (EF) : The percent of asset value that would be lost [from 0% to 100%]
    - Single Loss Expectancy (SLE) : The impact for a single event FORMULA: SLE=AV*EF
    - Annualized Rate of Occurance (ARO): How often in a single year the event is expected to occur
    - Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE) : The annualized impact FORMULA: ALE=SLE*ARO

** Important Formuala 's
SLE($) = AV($) x EF (%) : Single Loss Expectancy = Asset Value x Exposure Factor

ALE ($) = SLE ($) x ARO (#) : Annualized Loss Expectancy = Single Loss Expectancy x Annualized Rate of Occurance

Risk mitigation should be subject to a cost-benefit analysis
    - Cost-benefits analysis is the process of comparing the estimated costs and benefits to determine where it makes sense to 
    proceed from a business perspective.


Scenario

300 Webservers, Each host average of 100 websites. Business pay a monthly free of $75 for moneyback guranteed service
IT estimates that a ransomeware attack could encrypt 60% of servers.
They suggest ransomware attack coul occur every two years.

SLE & ALE Calclulations

Monthly Asset Value (AV) : 300 * (100*$75)  = $2,250,000
Exposure Factor (EF) : is 60%
Single Loss Expectancy (SLE) is $2,250,000 *.60 = $1,350,000
Annualized Rate of Occurance (ARO) is .5
Annaulaized Loss Expectancy (ALE) is $1,3500,000 *.5 = $675,000

# Risk Response and Treatment
- Avoid Terminate : Avoiding the risk elimate the cause or terminate activity.
- Transfer Risk : assign to another party insurrance. Transferred when likehood is low but the impact is high
    - Cyber insurrance protection against cyber incident financial losses
    - Business interruption insurance covers lost of income as well as cost of interruption for deined situations.

- Mitigate Risk : Reduce the impact or likelihood by implementing control or process change.
    - Control is a tactic that accomplishes reduces elimation of a vulnerability,likehood a threat would exploit a vulnerability
    - Countermeasures ar controls implemented to address a specific threat.
- Accept Risk : acknowledge and accept the level of risk and monitor it.
    - Risk appetite: level of risk entity is willing to accpet in pursuit of its missions
    - Risk tolerance : tactical and specific to the target being evaulated.


* Risk exception - risk has been identified, but not feasible or practical to implement standard risk treatment or control measures.
    - Exception handling process of approving an exception on either a temp or permanent basis.
    - Risk exemption is a formal decision not to address a risk at all. Implemented when potentia
    l impact of a risk is low and cost and effort required to mitigate the risk are disportionate to the potential impact

# Risk Mitigation Controls 
* - Controls strategies that mitigate risk by reducing or elimating vulnerabilities, threats, and impact
    - Control objective is a statement of desired result or purpose to be achieved by implementing a control or set of controls.
    - Defense-in-depth is a design and implementation of multiple overlapping layers of diverse control
    - Controls should be verifiable (trustworhy)
        - Functionality : Is what a control does
        - Effectivenss : how well a control works
        - Assurance : measure of confidence that intended security controls are effective in their application

# Risk Monitoring, Reporting, and Maturity
- Risk Register centrol repo for all risk-related doc, tracking, and accountability.

- Key Risk Indicators are predictors (early warning signals) of unfavorable events that can adversely impact an org.
- Lagging indicator derived from historical data.
- Maturity evolution and improvement of processes, systems, and capabilitites within an org over time.
    - Risk maturity model structued framework that helps org assess their curren risk managemnt capabilites

# Understand and Apply Threat Modeling Concepts and Methodologies
* - Threat : category of objects processes or events that represent a potential danger to an asset
* - Vulnerability : a weakness is a system, process, or person that can be exploited by a threat

* - Exploit : when a threat actor successfully takes advantage of a vulnerability.

* - Threat Actor (Agent): Adversary is an opponent, malicious intent
* - Targeted Attack : threat actor chooses a  target for a specific objective
* - Opportunistic Attack:  when a threat actor take s advantage of a vulnerable target not previously know to them.

* - Attack vector : a potential pathway or scenario used by an adversary to access or penetrate the target system or environment
    - Primary attack vectors include:
        - Digital infrastructure
        - People
        - Code
        - Physical infrastructure
        - An attack surface is the sum of all attack vectors

# Attack Vectors - Digital Infrastructure 
 - Objective of a digital infra attack is dirsuption, manipulation, or compromise of IT or operational technology systems.
- Amplification attack : attacker uses an amplication factor to multiply it power
    - Ex. use bonets to launch DDos attacks or spam 
- Reflection : attacker sends numberous requests to device with victim's ip. Conjucntion with amplification.

- Domain Hijacking : unauthorized modfification of a domain name registration. Ex. DNS settings
- URL Squatting : registrering or usng an internet domain name belonging to someone else
- Type Squatting: taking advantange of common typos to create fradulent domains
- OT : Operational Technology : Use of hardware and software systems to monitor and control physical processes in industrial settings

# Attack Vectors - People
- Social engineering action of exploiting human nature to gain acess minds, systems, data, or buildings
    - Pretexts are fabricated scenarios (Stories) ued to conceal the true purpose of an activity.

- Disinformation false or misleading information that is spread deliberately to deceive.
    - Shallow Fake : alteration of media content using simple video editing software
    - Deep Fake : use of machine learning and AI to manipulate or generate deceptive audo or video content.


# Attack Vectors - Code
* - 4 Common Code Attack Vectors : Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), Directory (Path) Traversal
* - Injection attack tricks an application into including unintended commands in the data sent to an interpreter.
* - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) : A XSS attack is an injection of malicious code into a web application or back-end database that will execute scripts in a victim's browser
* - Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) : tricks a web browser into executing a malicious action on a trusted site.
* - Directory Traversal : attack uses specially crafted input that includes sequences to traverse a directory and access files.


# Threat Modeling and Intelligence 
* - Threat Modeling a structured process by which potential threats, threat actors, and threat vectors can be identified, enumerated, and priortitized.
    - Work factor is time, effort, and resources necessary for the attacker to successfully achieve their objective.

* - Threat Modeling Approaches 
    - Asset-centric (WHAT | WHY ) : Identifies valued assets
    - Architecture-centric (HOW) : Identifies system design, component strength, and vulnerabilities
    - Attacker-centric (WHO) : Identifies motivated adversaries

* - Threat intelligence evidence-based knowledge about emerging threats that can be used to inform control decisions
    - OSINT : Open Source Intelligence : Data collected from publicly available sources to be used in an intelligence context
