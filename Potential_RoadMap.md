Track	Ideal for You If You Want to Be…
🛡️ Security Architect / Engineer	Designing secure systems (on-prem, cloud, hybrid)
☁️ Cloud Security Specialist	Deep in AWS/Azure/GCP security & DevSecOps
🎓 Security Leader / Manager / CISO	Driving security policy, governance, and risk
🐚 Technical Security Expert (Red/Blue Team)	More hands-on hacking or defending
🧱 Phase 1: Foundation (Now – Short Term)
Certification	Why It's Important	Timeframe
🔹 CompTIA Security+ (Optional)	Covers security fundamentals if you want a quick start or lack formal security exposure	1–2 months
🔹 Linux+ / RHCSA (Optional)	Demonstrates strong OS-level control and hardening (if you don’t already have certs for your Linux experience)	Optional
✅ CISSP	Validates broad knowledge of cybersecurity leadership, governance, and architecture	3–6 months

✅ Where you are now: You’re ready for CISSP based on your engineering background. You can skip Security+ unless you want a quick warm-up.

☁️ Phase 2: Cloud & Infrastructure Security (Mid-Term)
Certification	Focus	When to Take
✅ CCSP (Certified Cloud Security Professional)	Cloud architecture, DevSecOps, SaaS/PaaS/IaaS security	After CISSP or in parallel
✅ AWS/Azure/GCP Security Specialty	Deep dive into security for your preferred cloud platform	After or during CCSP
🔹 Terraform Associate / Kubernetes Security (CKS)	Demonstrates IaC and container security skills	Optional but great for DevOps/SREs

🎯 If you're heavily cloud-focused, CCSP + AWS/GCP/Azure Security Specialty is a killer combo.
