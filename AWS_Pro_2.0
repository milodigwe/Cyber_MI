AWS Compute Optimizer is an AWS service that helps you right-size your compute resources by analyzing how you actually use them and then giving recommendations to improve performance and reduce cost.



To central maangement IPs use a Prefix list, use RAM to share the list amongest members in org and different accounts.

Compute Optimizer recommends:

Optimal memory size

Expected performance impact

Estimated monthly cost

Potential cost savings

This is exactly why it’s commonly used for questions involving Lambda memory tuning and cost optimization.

ALB's do not support elastic IPs
NAT gateways use Elastic IP addresses for internet access

Assigning static Elastic IPs (from a BYOIP CIDR block) ensures:

All outbound API calls originate from a known, fixed CIDR

The third party can safely allowlist that CIDR
