✅ STEP 1 — Update Ubuntu

Open a terminal inside the VM:

sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

✅ STEP 2 — Install required build tools

These are required for the Guest Additions kernel modules:

sudo apt install build-essential dkms linux-headers-$(uname -r) -y

✅ STEP 3 — Insert Guest Additions CD

In the VM window menu:

Devices → Insert Guest Additions CD image…

If it asks to download, choose Download.

This mounts /dev/cdrom inside Ubuntu.

✅ STEP 4 — Install Guest Additions

Run:

sudo mount /dev/cdrom /media
sudo /media/VBoxLinuxAdditions.run


Watch for the message Installation successful.

Then reboot:

sudo reboot

✅ STEP 5 — Enable Auto-Resize

After reboot, go to:

View → Auto-resize Guest Display

If it’s already checked, uncheck → re-check it.

You can also toggle:

View → Virtual Screen 1 → Resize to <your resolution>

⚙️ IMPORTANT VirtualBox Setting

Before starting the VM next time, check these:

Settings → Display → Graphics Controller

Set to:

VMSVGA

And ensure:

✔ Enable 3D Acceleration

🎉 After this, your Ubuntu VM screen will expand automatically when you resize the VM window.

If the screen is still small, tell me what happens when you run:

lsmod | grep vbox
