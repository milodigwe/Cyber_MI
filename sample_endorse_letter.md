📂 CISSP Domain #1 – Security and Risk Management

As an SRE and DevOps engineer, I enforced infrastructure security policies and procedures aligned with compliance standards such as ISO 27001 and SOC2. I participated in incident response planning, DR/BCP testing, and risk assessments. I also worked closely with InfoSec and compliance teams to implement organizational security strategies, including logging, alerting, and regular patching cycles.

📂 CISSP Domain #3 – Security Architecture and Engineering

I designed and maintained secure cloud and on-premises infrastructure. This included configuring hardened Linux servers, securing Kubernetes clusters, and implementing encryption (at rest and in transit) using industry best practices. I was also responsible for patch management automation and ensuring compliance with secure baseline configurations using tools like Ansible and CIS Benchmarks.

📂 CISSP Domain #5 – Identity and Access Management (IAM)

I implemented centralized identity and access control solutions using tools such as Okta, AWS IAM, and LDAP. This included provisioning and de-provisioning access through automation, enforcing MFA, managing role-based access controls (RBAC), and integrating SSO across internal tools and platforms.

📂 CISSP Domain #7 – Security Operations

In my role as an SRE, I built and maintained monitoring systems using Prometheus, Grafana, ELK, and Splunk to detect anomalies and respond to security events. I participated in on-call rotations and was involved in root cause analysis (RCA) and post-mortems following security incidents and outages. I also helped integrate alerting pipelines for SIEM platforms and developed runbooks for operational response.

📂 CISSP Domain #8 – Software Development Security

I integrated security tools into CI/CD pipelines (e.g., Snyk, Trivy, SonarQube) to automatically scan for vulnerabilities in code and container images. I enforced secure coding standards across the development lifecycle, implemented secrets management solutions, and supported engineering teams in remediating security flaws in applications and infrastructure.
